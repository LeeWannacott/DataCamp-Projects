# DataCamp-Projects

This project looks into the effect the advent of handwashing had on the proportion of deaths at clinics.
A look at data before and after handwashing procedures were introduced.

Semmelweis' theory — that childbed fever was caused by some "substance" (what we today know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses — was ridiculed by contemporary scientists. The medical community largely rejected his discovery and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.

One reason for this was that statistics were uncommon in medical science in the 1800s. Semmelweis only published his data as long tables of raw data, but he didn't show any graphs nor confidence intervals. If he would have had access to the analysis put together he might have been more successful in getting the Viennese doctors to wash their hands.

Doctors not washing their hands increased the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval. It would seem that Semmelweis had solid evidence that handwashing was a simple but highly effective procedure that could save many lives.
